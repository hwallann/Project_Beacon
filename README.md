# Project Underwater Rugby (UWR)
This project was about trying to get an IoT device to successfully transmit data from underwater. This was to be used to track the performance of Underwater Rugby players. If the device lost connection due to depth, it should try to reconnect while the player resurfaces.

From the trials, the device could not mentain a connection after being submerged for about 1 meter, and it failed to reconnect when it resurfaced.
